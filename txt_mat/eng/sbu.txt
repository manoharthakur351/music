I Can Never be Without Your Love
You Know Me
Your Love is in My Heart and Blood
It Runs Deep
Whatever You Want In Life You Know
It's On Me

I'll be Standing By You Till the End
Yeah We Built It Over Trust
I'll Never Get Enough
You Got Me All In Love With You

So Many things I do and Girl
You Never Wana Judge
And Baby You're The Reason
That I Ever Fell In Love
You Never Gave Me Drama
So No Need To Walk Away
Girl, I Just Wanna Be Right With you Every Single Day
And If There's Any Trouble Yeah
We Coming Through As One
You Know I Got You Back
In Every way Under The Sun
Girl, I will be Staring Looking At You
Every Single Night
I just Gotta Let You Know
You Brighten Up My Life

Pyaar Di Rawaa Utte Yaar Tu Le Aya...
Mainu Jeene Da Matlab Aaj Samajh Aya...
Paraya Mainu Kar Na... Na Tu Sohniya...
Channa Main Tu Rull Jaana...

Tor Bhalobhasha Uure Geche Amake
Tai Jodu Kichu Chao Amake Janiye
Protidin Ami Boli Meye Tui Amer Ei Jibun....
Shopno Puron Kore' Dibo Je Kono Rokhom...
Jotokhon Tumi Amar Shathe' Ar Kew Jani Na...
Jotokhon Tumi Nai Ar Kichu Pari Na...

Girl, I Just Want Your Lovin
All The Time And Everyday...
Tor Mone Joto Badha Takhe Shob Chere De

Bulaave Tujhe Yaar Aaj Meri Galiyaan
Basau Tere Sang Main Alag Duniyaa
Na Aaye Kabhi Dono Mein Jara Bhi Faasle
Bas Ek Tu Ho, Ek Main Hu Aur Koi Na

Hai Mera Sab Kuch Tera Tu Samajh Le
Tu Chahe Mere Haq Ki Zameen Rakh Le
Tu Saason Pe Bhi Naam Tera Likh De
Main Jiyu Jab Jab Tera Dil Dhadke
